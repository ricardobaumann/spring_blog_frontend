# spring_blog_frontend
A simple spring frontend for the spring blog api backend

## Installation
- Clone it
- On the root folder, run `mvn clean install spring-boot:run`
- Install and run the spring blog api (http://github.com/ricardobaumann/spring_blog_api)
- The frontend application, by default, will look for its backend on http://localhost:8081. Change it on application.yml if you need to. 

## Usage
- Hit http://localhost:8080 and navigate through the application

## Notes
- This application intends to be just a very simple example of a thymeleaf frontend application, connected to a rest backend service. 
- Im not a frontend developer, so feel free to PR some frontend enhancements :)
- There is a lot of code enhancements that need to be done on it. Its just a simple example.
